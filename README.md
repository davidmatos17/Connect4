# Connect4
Connect-4 game with integrated AI bot

By running interface.py you can play against an AI bot (there are 3 different level bots) being A* the dumb one, MCTS very hard, and MinMax the impossible one.

If you choose to play against another person using the same terminal, you can run humanVsHuman.py and play in turns.

Good luck gamers!
